## Features

- Based on the version of WINE from Valve (Proton) and its modifications (Proton GE).
  Includes a set of scripts combined with wine-proton itself, a Steam Runtime Sniper container with the addition of
  ported mangoHud (output useful information over the game window: FPS, frametime, CPU, GPU, etc.),
  vkBasalt (improvement of graphics in games, great alongside FSR or DLSS) versions,
  and many already configured optimizations for maximum performance.

- For fans of console games, there are many console emulators to choose from (in the EMULATORS tab): PPSSPP, Citra, Cemu, ePSXe, MAME, and many others.
